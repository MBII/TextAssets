Echani Fighting Style (Melee knockback x1.5, resistance to melee)

Hailing from an academy comprised of near identical handmaidens, the Echani have trained themselves to understand the nature of war
and thus make ideal Jedi.
Their powerful melee style compliments their use of intense dual lightsabers in combat.
