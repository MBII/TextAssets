The Ubese were highly trained members of the Merchant's Guild, and it is surmised that they only joined the Sith
for profit.
While somewhat attuned to the Force, the Ubese' prowess came in their preparation to deal with Jedi through the use of gadgets to sap their movement and Force ability.
Although they carried lightsabers, they lacked the natural finesse of the Jedi and were usually no match for them in hand-to-hand combat.
