Tessek was a male Quarren who was an accountant for the Hutt crime lord Jabba Desilijic Tiure,[1] as well as a patron of his, enjoying the decadent atmosphere of Jabba's Palace and frequenting parties there.[3] A clever individual, Tessek approached his life in Jabba's employ with a highly calculating mind. He took advantage of his position as Jabba's bookkeeper, to secretly embezzle money into his own accounts and plotted to assassinate his employer, aspiring to take over Jabba's vast criminal empire.
