description	"Ninja Footsoldier

Weaponry:
Ninjato
Smoke Black Eggs (secondary grenade)

Attributes:
Ninja Rebirth (reinforcements)

The ninja were a group of stealthy mercenaries or assassins who practiced the unorthodox arts of war. In their arsenal was the black egg, which would either be used to blind or distract the enemy. Their sword, the ninjato, was unlike the katana in that it had a straight blade, and was treated like a tool rather than a symbolic weapon."
