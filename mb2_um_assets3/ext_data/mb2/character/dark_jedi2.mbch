description	"Sith Miraluka

Lightsaber
Saber Offense 3
Saber Defense 3
Force Jump 3
Force Block 3
Force Pull 3
Force Push 3
Force Sight (Sense 3, Stat viewer)
Force Healing (Health dispenser)
Force Shrouding (Invisible to Force Sense)

Blinded only physically, the Miraluka have trained themselves to see through the force and effectively through
solid objects.
The Miraluka were naturally attuned to the Force and find that such powers as healing and stealth come naturally to them.
