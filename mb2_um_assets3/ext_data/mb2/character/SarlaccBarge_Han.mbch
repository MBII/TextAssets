description      "Han Solo

Equipment:
- Pistol (2)

Attributes:
- Dodge (3)
- Heal (3)

After only just being freed from the carbonite, Han was quickly swooped off to the pit of carkoon whilst still under the side-effects of staying in carbonite.
On the trip to the Pit, his vision improved so much that he could "see a light blur instead of a dark blur", Luke promptly reminded him there was nothing to see on tatooine anyway.
Han Solo has stolen a pistol from one of the guards and is now using to kill Jabba's hencemen"
