- Pistol (2)

A high-stakes gambler with underworld connections, Lando Calrissian in recent years has made an effort to turn 'Respectable' as he puts it.
Having been the Baron-Administrator of Cloud City at the time Han Solo was captured, Lando felt responsible for his friend's misfortune. 
Enough so, that he's thrown his lot in with other friends of Solo, in a daring and dangerous rescue attempt to save Han from the clutches of Jabba the Hutt."
