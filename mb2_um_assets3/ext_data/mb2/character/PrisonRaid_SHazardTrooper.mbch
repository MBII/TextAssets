Hazard Suite

Hazard troopers wore a very heavy body suit that offered complete immunity to temperature extremes and chemical hazards. It also granted near invulnerability to small-arms fire. It also worked as a functioning space suit which could keep the wearer alive in a vacuum or underwater environment for up to three days.
Hazard troopers were commonly equipped with either an Imperial heavy repeater or a Stouker concussion rifle, or, less commonly, a Merr-Sonn PLX-2M portable missile system."
