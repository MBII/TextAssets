After the death of Marek, Vader endeavored to create a more powerful and obedient version of his fallen disciple, using a cloning facility on the planet Kamino to carry out this agenda. Starkiller was affected by the emotional imprints that he inherited from his template and consequently developed a fixation on Captain Juno Eclipse, a former Imperial officer whom Marek fell in love with. Dismissed by his master as another setback in a long line of failures, the clone fled from Kamino and began traveling across the galaxy to find Eclipse."
