description	"Ninja Footsoldier(staff)

Weaponry:
Bo (staff)

Abilities:
Thrown Metsubishi (blind)
Light Acrobatics (dexterity 2)

An often used tactic of the ninja was to blind their adversaries, to use as a distraction or to gain the upper hand in a fight. Another traditional weapon of the ninja was the bo staff. It could be passed off as a walking stick and therefore easily conceilable."
