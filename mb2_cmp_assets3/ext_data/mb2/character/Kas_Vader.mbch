Always keen to make sure things are running smoothly in the Empire, Darth Vader visits many key worlds and imperial bases, Kashyyyk being one of the unlucky few. 
Not known for his compassion, Darth Vader strangles anyone who fails to meet with his high expectations; the road of promotion with Darth Vader is a fast but ultimately deadly road. 
Both the famous and infamous members of the Rebel Alliance have had run-ins with the Sith Lord himself, and most barely escaped with their lives, some even lost their lives."
