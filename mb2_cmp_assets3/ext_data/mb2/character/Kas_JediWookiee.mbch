Whilst Han Solo was making preparations to go into combat with the local imperial garrison, a Wookiee was watching him, not just any Wookiee, a skilled Jedi Wookiee.
During the battle Han Solo was ambushed by the Jedi Wookiee, and then the Wookiee attacked him by means of a friendly hug and a loud friendly roar in his ears, which of course, Han Solo enjoyed with much regret..
Han Solo, being deafened by the roar, didn't realise the Wookiee was a Jedi, but when finally freed from a vice-like grip and was told, he welcomed the Wookiee into his attack group, whilst rubbing his ribs."
