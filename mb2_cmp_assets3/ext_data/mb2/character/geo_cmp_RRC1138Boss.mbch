Boss started off exactly the same as his commando brethren. As his training progressed, he consistently ranked highest in his squad for accuracy and all-around fighting ability. He even managed to break Sergeant Walon Vau's arm in training. It was because of these qualities that Vau appointed him as the leader of Delta Squad.
A clone commando, or Republic commando, was an elite soldier of the Grand Army of the Republic. Often working in groups of four, clone commandos were assigned to carry out covert operations too delicate for regular clone troopers. Covert infiltration, sabotage, foreign unit training, and assassination were standard tasks for the clone commandos."
