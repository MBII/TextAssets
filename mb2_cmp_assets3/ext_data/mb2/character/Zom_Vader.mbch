Being told by the Imperial Health Inspector agents that the next closure might have quite a bit of trouble, Darth Vader moved quickly to assemble several groups of the Health Unit's Stormtroopers, Sanitation Security.
Darth Vader is moving quickly to try and save the Imperial Health Unit from a almost tasty and certain doom at MacZombies. Perhaps he may manage to save this unit before it's too late. The health inspector agents also report that the chefs and MacZombie himself are armed with lightsabers.
Vader thinks they are unskilled with the sabers."
