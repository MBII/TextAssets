The two-meter tall MagnaGuards carried electrostaffs made from lightsaber-resistant phrik metal, and sometimes wore cloaks similar to those of Grievous's old Izvoshra elite during the general's time as a Kaleesh warlord.
The electrostaff was an electronic melee weapon constructed of lightsaber-resistant phrik alloy equipped with electromagnetic pulse-generating tips. Though some staffs could penetrate and neutralize ray shields, most were simply used as blunt-force melee weapons."
