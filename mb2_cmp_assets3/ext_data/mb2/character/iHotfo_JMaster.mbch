Details:

    Jedi Master Nylgo Vees was a Jedi Knight who survived the Jedi Purge of the Empire. While studying under Luke Skywalker he quickly achieved the rank of Master, and now assists Skywalker at the Praxeum as a teacher of the Force. His knowledge of the force and force techniques are almost as extensive and powerful as Skywalker, his saber skills, however, are not; and Vees prefers diplomacy over direct saber combat. Never the less, his advanced force techniques and his leadership of his top quality students made him a candidate for this important mission."
