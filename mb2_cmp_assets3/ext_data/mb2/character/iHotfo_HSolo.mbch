Details:

Chewbacca felt it only fitting to assist The Jedi Praxeum after being assisted by Jaden Korr on Tatooine. After hearing that Luke was assembling an attack force on a Cultist facility, he coaxed his long time partner Han Solo into joining him. Solo wields a powerfully Upgraded DL-44 and a couple of fragmentation grenades. Either by sheer luck or skill, he manages to avoid a good portion of the blaster bolts that come his way through misses and dodges. Solo also weilds a pair of Fragmentation grenades which he can throw from his belt with his free hand."
