General Grantok is older than the Empire. Once a loyal member of the Naboo security forces during the Clone Wars, he sensed the winds of change and threw his lot in with the nascent Empire. He knew Anakin Skywalker and Padme Amidala years ago and carries a grudge against Darth Vader for killing two of the most honorable people he knew."
