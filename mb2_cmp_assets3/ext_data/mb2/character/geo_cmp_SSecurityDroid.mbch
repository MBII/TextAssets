B1s were perhaps the most numerous�and expendable�soldiers in galactic history, and, unlike most organic soldiers, they were capable of action in hostile environments like underwater or in space. They were designed to swamp their enemies with sheer numbers.
OOM security battle droids were security droids of the Trade Federation and Confederacy of Independent Systems used for the purposes of defense and detection."
