Details:
Her cool blue eyes and her swaying Tholoth headdress pointed to her familial connection to Master Gallia, but Stass Allie had only ascended to the level of Jedi Knight by the time the Clone Wars began. Though an experienced warrior and field agent of note, she would increasingly concentrate on the healing arts practiced by the Circle of Jedi Healers."
