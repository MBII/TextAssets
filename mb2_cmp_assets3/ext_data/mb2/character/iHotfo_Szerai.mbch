Details:

Szerai was one of the Jedi recruited by Luke Skywalker to train at the Praxeum on Yavin IV. Preying on her weakness of being captured, and with the promise of power, Tavion turned Szerai to the darkside and imbued her with power from the Scepter of Ragnos. Szerai's empowerment with the scepter makes her both a powerful and deadly foe. She leads the cultist forces as the most experienced dark jedi."
