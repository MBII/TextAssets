Details:

Aayla Secura, a Rutian Twi'lek, was trained under the tutelage of Quinlan Vos and his Master Tholme, who also rescued her from slavery on Ryloth years before. Years later, together with Quinlan, she repayed the favour and rescued her former mentor, Master Tholme, on Kintan from Kh'aris Fenn. For her effort, she was elevated to the rank of Jedi Knight."
