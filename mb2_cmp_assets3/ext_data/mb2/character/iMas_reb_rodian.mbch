Details:

These rodians have joined the Rebels, as they are sympathetic to their cause. These two are specialists in starship and droid repair.  Some are using their knowledge and the tools of the trade to prepare for the defense of the rebel base.   The Rebel commanders are expecting Assault Droids, possibly the 5400-series, these have limited weapons though.  The Rodians were the first to step to the challenge of dealing with the droids, due to their often aggressive nature. They have constructed portable forcefields by using their knowledge on ship shields, and have armed the EMP grenades they would normally use on wayward droids.  They also have tracking darts so it's easier to follow the droids, and finally, a light CP-50 to defend themselves with. "
