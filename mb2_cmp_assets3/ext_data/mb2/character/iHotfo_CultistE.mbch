Details:

The majority of the Disciples of Ragnos were the so-called Sith Cultists, and were empowered with Force energy siphoned into the scepter. The Sith Cultists were trained either in lightsaber combat or various dark side force techniques, such as Force lightning, Force Grip and Force Drain. They formed the backbone of the organization and were present in force on nearly all of the cult's missions. These cultists wore a black battle suit and were able to defeat ordinary enemies fairly easily, though they were not skilled or disciplined enough to defeat an average Jedi from Luke Skywalker's Jedi Praxeum."
