Details:

After Desann's defeat at the hands of Kyle Katarn on Yavin IV, those Reborn who had survived rallied under Tavion Axmis. The Reborn serving Tavion changed their name to the 'New Reborn'. They were the elite of the cult, possessing better fighting skills and greater force powers than the ordinary cultists. A branch of the New Reborn, such as this one, are nicknamed 'Marauders' to align itself with the ancient sith marauders who used their rage to fuel the power needed to strike down jedi foes."
