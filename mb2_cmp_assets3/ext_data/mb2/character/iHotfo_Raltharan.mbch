Details:

Raltharan, a Jedi Wookiee, was one of the Jedi recruited by Luke Skywalker to train at the Praxeum on Yavin IV. Wielding a Double bladed lightsaber Raltharan, training under Jedi Master Corran Horn, focuses his saber skills to a fine edge; a feature that is complemented by his Wookiee strength and vitality. Currently, he is the Academy's finest saber students; part of the reason he was selected to come on this mission. However, unlike Jaden, his force power abilities are severely limited."
