Description:
Darth Tyrannus was once the Jedi Master who taught the famed Qui Gon Jinn. However, on his quest to find a balance between the dark and light (grey), he fell out with the Jedi Council.
In his quest, he then came accross Palpatine, and ultimately, without realising it, fell into the trap of the darkside.
Now Dooku only answers to his master, and plans to steal the location of the much needed crystals for the super weapon his master plans to build."
