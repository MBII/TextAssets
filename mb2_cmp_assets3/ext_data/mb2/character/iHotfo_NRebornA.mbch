After Desann's defeat, those Reborn who had survived rallied under Tavion Axmis. The Reborn serving Tavion changed their name to the 'New Reborn'. They were the elite of the cult, possessing better fighting skills and greater force powers than the ordinary cultists. A branch of the New Reborn, such as this one, are nicknamed 'Avengers' to avenge the deaths of the reborn killed by the Jedi."
