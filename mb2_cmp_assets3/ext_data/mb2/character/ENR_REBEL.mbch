The Alliance Army was founded and operated until the Battle of Endor as a guerrilla force ï¿½ aimed at tying down and harassing an enemy force rather than meeting that enemy in open battle. An Alliance Army force could expect to be outnumbered in any given battle it fought against the Imperial Army, and as such its tactics were geared towards 'hit and run' rather than conventional battle."
