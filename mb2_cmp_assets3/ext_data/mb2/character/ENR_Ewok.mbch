Reinforcements (1)

Because of the ewoks good nature, and the willingness to protect their golden god also known as C3PO, the have sent some of their best warriors to assist the other rebels at the shield generator. As the Ewoks dont have any real weapon, they have armed themselves with stones and sticks from trees."
