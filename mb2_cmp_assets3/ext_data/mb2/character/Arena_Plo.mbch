Details:
As a member of the Kel Dor race, Jedi Master Plo Koon has to wear protective goggles and a face-concealing antitox-mask to survive in oxygen-rich environments, yet this heritage makes him probably the most martial member of the jedi council as well. Plo Koon used a light-side version of Force Lightning to stun his enemies, a power he referred to as 'Electric Judgement'."
