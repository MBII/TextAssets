Description:
Mace Windu is one of the most serious, and yet, more casual Jedi on the council. His saber style reflects his serious nature, falling dangerously close to the aggressive tactics employed by the Sith.
Since Mace has much experience in combat, he is able to fight extremely well, even when against some of the most dangerous foes of the far reaches of the Galaxy.
His style, whilst slow, shows detailed thought in every movement, and yet, it is laden with aggressive styles - most of his moves kill, rather than wound, unlike typical Jedi protocol."
