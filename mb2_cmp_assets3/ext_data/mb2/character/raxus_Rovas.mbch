Details:
Battle Armor was some of the heaviest armor employed as of the Jedi Civil War. Designed for use by heavy militias, it had the protection needed to keep a soldier alive during ranged combat with massive weapons.

Battle armor was constructed from a mesh of metal or composite plates and a padded jumpsuit. Variants of the armor included less plates and more padding for a lighter, though less protective armor, and heavier plating with molded pieces to fit the wearer. Though the armor was available unmodified, most users personalized their armor."
