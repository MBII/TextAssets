Details:

Shiin Methrist, a Female Mirialan Jedi, was one of the Jedi recruited by Luke Skywalker to train at the Praxeum on Yavin IV. Trained under Jedi Master Nylgo Vees, Shiin focuses her strength primarily in her force abilities. Currently, she is the most force attuned student in the Praxeum. She is also one of the few students who can operate force powers both telekinetically and telepathically. She came with Master Vees on this mission for this reason. However, her saber skills in both attack and defense are among the worst in the academy, and she usually relies on other Jedi to do the close combat."
