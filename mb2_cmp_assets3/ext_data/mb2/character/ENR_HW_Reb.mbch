The Alliance Army was founded and operated until the Battle of Endor as a guerrilla force ï¿½ aimed at tying down and harassing an enemy force rather than meeting that enemy in open battle. These troops, however, were completely different from the common grunt. These troops had one goal in mind when deployed on the battlefield, anti-armor."
