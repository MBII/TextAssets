Details:

The Emperor's Royal Guard, also called Imperial Royal Guard, was a highly elite guard unit tasked with the protection of Emperor Palpatine, often as well as other High Ranking Imperials. However, these particular Royal Guards have, by Vader's request and the Emperors approval been detached to serve as an Auxillary force to the invasion of the Rebel Base on Yavin 4. Wielding force pikes and blaster pistols, these well trained Guards act as a Backup for Vader and will assist him in his efforts to try and capture Luke Skywalker.
