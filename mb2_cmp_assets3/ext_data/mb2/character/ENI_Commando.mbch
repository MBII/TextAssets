Imperial commandos were a choice group of soldiers selected from the Imperial Officer Corps. These men were only the most dedicated, excelled, and cunning officers drafted from the Corps, which was a prestigious group in itself. Unlike other officers, the Imperial commandos had a special knack for combat which, combined with their high status, made them the ultra-elite of the Galactic Empire's ground troops."
