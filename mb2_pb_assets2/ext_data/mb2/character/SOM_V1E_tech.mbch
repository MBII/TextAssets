Tech support units are tasked with providing allies with much needed health and ammunition when necessary. They can deploy sentry droids and seeker drones to supplement their own lack of firepower, as well as utilize pulse grenades to deal with certain annoying droid classes. On top of all of this, they are excellent hackers. They are, however, very poor fighters.
