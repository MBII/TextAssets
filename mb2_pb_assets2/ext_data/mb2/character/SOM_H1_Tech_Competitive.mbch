  Low Damage / Regens Ammo
Blaster Pistol: (2)
2 Pulse Grenades
Wrench
- Based on a Lightsaber

Portable Sentry
E-Web Blaster Cannon

Attributes:

Close-Combat Training: (2)
Reinforcements: (2) (CTF: 10s respawn)
Assemble - Respawns on characters with Rally
Ammunition Supplies - Drops ammo for allies
Armor Regeneration Supplies - Hold use on Ally to Regen their Armor
