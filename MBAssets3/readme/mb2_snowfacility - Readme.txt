.map file included in case any minor bugfixes are required - please don't make any non-bugfix alterations without letting me know.
Feel free to do anything you want with the .map file really, but again I'd like to know if you're going to edit it for use in MB2.
I'd rather you didn't edit the FA files, but if it would make the difference between you playing the map and not, go ahead.
