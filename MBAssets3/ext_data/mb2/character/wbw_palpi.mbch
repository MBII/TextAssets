After the Lothal Jedi Temple came under the control of the Empire, an ancient painting of the Mortis gods was uncovered on its facade. The Emperor believed it was a gateway to a world between worlds - a place where time and space could be manipulated. He was obsessed with unlocking the portal, but proved unsuccessful. The Padawan learner, Ezra Bridger, however, figured out the painting's secrets and entered the mystical plain within. Through dark arts, Palpatine could peer into the world between worlds."
