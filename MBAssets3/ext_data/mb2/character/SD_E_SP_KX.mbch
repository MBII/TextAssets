 KX-series security droids, also referred to as KX-series enforcer droids, were a model of security droid manufactured by Arakyd Industries that was in service to the Galactic Empire during the Galactic Civil War. While the Imperial Senate had prohibited the creation of battle droids, Arakyd was able to use a loophole in the law by marketing the KX-series as 'security droids. They were programmed without the standard restriction against harming organic sentient lifeforms."
