Mace Windu was a prominent Jedi Master during the final years of the Republic. A Korunnai Human from Haruun Kal, Windu served as one of the last members of the Jedi High Council before the Great Jedi Purge. On the Council Windu was often regarded as second only to Grand Master Yoda, though the Human was eight centuries Yoda's junior. Windu's wisdom and power were legendary, as were the weight of his words. Widely considered one of the best swordsmen in the Jedi Order, Windu created Vaapad, the modern seventh form of lightsaber combat. It is said that only Grand Master Yoda and Windu's old friend Dooku had defeated Mace Windu in combat."
