Perhaps the most numerous soldiers in galactic history--designed to swamp their enemies with sheer numbers--they were capable of action in hostile environments such as underwater or in space.

B1 Battle Droids were usually slaved to a Central Control Computer located on a remote starship or some other well-defended facility. However, this could lead to massive failure if the Central Control Computer were to be destroyed."
