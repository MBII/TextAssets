The Empire has a vast supply of factories developping weapons for them. Training and focus is what most are truly missing. These pilots focus on mostly on their flying/driving skill and thus lack the marksmenship. 
The Empire though, does supply them with a nice range of weapons to use, eventhough they're not that skilled with them.

The battle over Hoth has caused them to lose their AT-AT, after chasing a Snowspeeder trying to take on their vehicle. They were lucky enough to survive the crash. Their luck may be little, but could show itself during groundcombat. To boost their odds, they picked up everything they could from the wrecks of their AT-AT's, including binoculars and portable sentry turrets."
