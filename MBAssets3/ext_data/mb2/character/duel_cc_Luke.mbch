On the swamp planet of Dagobah, Luke learned the ways of the Force from the 900 year old Jedi Master, Yoda. Skywalker's training proved to be difficult, as his adventurous past had shaped his mind towards action and emotional instinct.
When Yoda asked him to enter a cave in which he was supposed to find only what he took with him, he was challenged by a vision of himself wearing Darth Vader's armor. Shortly after, he had a vision of Han Solo and Princess Leia suffering at Cloud City on Bespin. Despite Yoda and Kenobi's warnings and disapproval, Skywalker rashly left Dagobah to rescue them...

Little did Luke know that it was all an elaborate trap devised by Darth Vader."
