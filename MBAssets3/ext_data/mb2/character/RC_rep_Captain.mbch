Even among clones, there is a heirarchy. Three-Eight is undisputed leader of the Deltas.  Relatively taciturn, when he speaks, it's usually to bark out an order to his squad. Three-Eight has earned the respect and loyalty of his squad, and he repays that dedication in strong leadership. Despite being trained by Walon Vau, Three-Eight somehow inherited Jango's strong Concord Dawn accent and speech patterns."
