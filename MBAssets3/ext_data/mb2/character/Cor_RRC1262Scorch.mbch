Six-Two earned the nickname ''Scorch'' after an ordnance accident during training that left him and his instructor, Sergeant Walon Vau, without eyebrows for a short time. Scorch was one of the most individual clone troopers in the Republic forces. He had an over-developed sense of irony, and was the resident wiseguy of Delta Squad, much to the annoyance of some of his peers.
A clone commando, or Republic commando, was an elite soldier of the Grand Army of the Republic. Often working in groups of four, clone commandos were assigned to carry out covert operations too delicate for regular clone troopers. Covert infiltration, sabotage, foreign unit training, and assassination were standard tasks for the clone commandos."
