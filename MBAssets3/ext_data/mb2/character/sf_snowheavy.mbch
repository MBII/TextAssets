The Heavy Infantry are one of the two variants to the Elite Corps featured in the Imperial Task Force. These snowtroopers act as front-line assault units, with powerful weapons and explosives to accomplish this task. Their armor appears identical to it's Light counterpart, but offers far more protection at the cost of restrained mobility. Although a sizeable force they are fewer in numbers from regular Grunts, but are much more difficult to kill."
