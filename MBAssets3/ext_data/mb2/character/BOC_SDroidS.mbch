B1 battle droids were battle droids that made up the backbone of the Trade Federation Droid Army and the Separatist Droid Army. It was the successor of the hunter-killer droid. As sniper droids were popular targets of Jedi Knights, some of them were outfitted with poison darts designed to interfere with a Jedi's connection to the Force and to weaken their senses.b"
