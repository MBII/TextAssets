Dual Pistols	(4)
Fragmentation Grenade (1)

Items:
Armour (3)
Ammo (3)

Abilities:
Dodge (3)

The Force clouds Durn Dunnley's future, but it appears to be strong with him. As a boy, Durn dreamed of becoming an Imperial Stormtrooper, although as he matured he came to realize the evil inherent in the Empire.
Alternatively both an albatross and a good luck charm, Durn has a miraculous history of near-death experiences followed by improbable escapes, including surviving three ship crashes, being captured and then mistakenly released from two Imperial prisons, and losing twenty-eight helmets to stray blaster fire.
Durn has taken up Jinna Kejj's search for her lost sister, lending a certain luck of his own to the quest."
