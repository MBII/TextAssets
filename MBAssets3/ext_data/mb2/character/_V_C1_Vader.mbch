After pledging his allegiance to Darth Sidious, Anakin Skywalker became Darth Vader, servant of the Empire, scourge of the Jedi, and master of the dark side of the Force. Shortly after this christening, and the slaughter of many Jedi, Vader would sustain life-threatening and body-altering injuries in a duel with his former Jedi master Obi-Wan Kenobi, becoming more machine than man and fully cementing his fall to the dark side."
