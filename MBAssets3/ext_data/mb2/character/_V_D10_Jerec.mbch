Jerec was a dedicated archaeologist and Jedi Master, well-versed in knowledge of the Jedi Order's past--particularly the Sith. Having been researching in the Unknown Regions when Order 66 was issued, Jerec survived only to return and be twisted to the Dark Side by the Emperor's Inquisitors, eventually becoming one of the most feared Inquisitors himself. One of the most powerful Dark Jedi in the Empire, Jerec is obsessed with the Valley of the Jedi, and the vast amounts of trapped Force energy there."
