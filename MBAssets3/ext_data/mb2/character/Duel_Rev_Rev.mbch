Once a promising and talented pupil of the Jedi Order, Revan joined the war against the Mandalorians against the wishes of the Jedi Council to protect the Republic, upon the end of the war he and his friend, Alek, vanished following the Battle of Malachor V.
When they eventually returned it was at the head of a massive invasion force, now identifying himself as Darth Revan, Dark Lord of the Sith, with Alek now his Sith Apprentice, Malak.
A surprise attack on his cruiser has left him to defend himself against the Jedi Strike Team, lead by Padawan Bastila."
