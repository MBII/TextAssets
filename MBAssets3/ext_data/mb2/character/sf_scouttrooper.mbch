description	"Snowtrooper Scout

Weapons:

Melee: (X)
Blaster Pistol: (2)
E-11s Sniper Rifle: (2)
E-11 Blaster Rifle: (2) 

Equipment:

Big Bacta: (X) 
Tracking Darts: (1) 

Attributes:

Ammo (3)
Assemble
Respawns (1)
Dodge (3)

Details:

Applying the term 'scout' to these soldiers is perhaps disingenuous, as their role is less oriented towards reconaisance and more oriented towards being excellent snipers. Fast moving, decently armored, and carrying powerfully precise E-11s Sniper rifles, they pick and track key targets, and exterminate them with extreme prejudice."
