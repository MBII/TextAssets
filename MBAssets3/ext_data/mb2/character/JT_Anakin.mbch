A child born of prophecy, possibly conceived by the will of the Force itself. The Jedi Council was reluctant to train the boy, feeling his future to be clouded and that Anakin was too old to begin Jedi training. During the Clone Wars, he found himself in the middle of a political power struggle between the Jedi Council and the Chancellor. It was at this moment of Skywalker's greatest confusion that Palpatine opened up to him. When he saved the Chancellor from Mace Windu, Anakin had committed himself to the dark path. He knelt before Palpatine, who revealed himself as Darth Sidious, proclaiming himself to be a servant of the Sith."
