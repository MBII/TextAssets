Ki-Adi-Mundi was a Cerean Jedi Master, and Jedi Council member. He hailed from the planet Cerea and, due to the low Cerean birthrate, he was allowed by the Jedi Order to follow the Cerean custom of polygynous marriage. He had four honor wives, one son, and seven daughters.

Ki-Adi-Mundi's duties as a General of the Grand Army of the Republic meant he was unable to go to the assistance of his own world, Cerea, when it was attacked. In the ensuing battle, Ki-Adi-Mundi's entire family was killed by the CIS. Adhering to the Jedi Code, he grieved privately, then returned to his duties.

When the 21st Nova Corps became the Galactic Marines and were made independent of the 4th Sector Army, the Marines were placed under Ki-Adi-Mundi's command."
