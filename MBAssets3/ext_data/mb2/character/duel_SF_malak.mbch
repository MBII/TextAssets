Once the closest friend of the Jedi Revan, he followed him down the path of the Dark Side, becoming Revan's apprentice. Seizing an opportunity to kill his master and assume the title of Master, he fired into Revan's ship during a battle. Since his ascension, he has ruthlessly destroyed all foes in his path. With Revan's return, however, all that he has wrought now lies in jeopardy."
