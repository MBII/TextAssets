Jango Fett was a renowned bounty hunter who was hired by Count Dooku to serve as the template for the Republic Clone Army during the waning days of the Old Republic. In return for his DNA, Jango had but one request: an unaltered clone of himself. The result was Boba, whom Jango came to regard as a son."
