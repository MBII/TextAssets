The Reborn were a deadly force of Dark Jedi of the Empire Reborn faction. An accomplishment of the dream of artificial infusion of the Force into individuals. Due to being largely untrained, their combat performance is barely superior to that of the other remnant's non-force-weilding troops. However, having been produced en-masse, they heavily outnumber the more professionally trained Jedi."
