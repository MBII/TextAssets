Projectile Rifle

Stamina (1)

Clone Snipers were usually deployed in areas where a squad had to cross open terrain, and stayed behind to cover their advance.  Later in the war it was discovered their weapons had the power to punch through some of the strongest droid chassis, so their deployment became more common."
