Form VI (Niman):
Often called 'The Diplomat's Form,' Niman attempts to balance all elements of lightsaber combat, combining techniques from Forms that came before into a less intensely demanding combat style. The result was that the user's skill in each individual area of lightsaber combat was relatively moderate--they did not excel in any one area.

Due to its 'jack-of-all-trades' nature, the success of the form is largely dependant on the practitioner's intuition, improvisation, and creativity in combat, rather than the rote responses derived from other forms. This broad generalization made Form VI well-suited for diplomats, as they could spend their time training in the areas of politics and negotiation instead of combat training."
