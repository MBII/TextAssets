Agen Kolar, Jedi Master and a member of the Zabrak species from Iridonia. He spoke in a gentle Zabrak baritone. Kolar was loyal to the Jedi Order, and often favored aggressive negotiations over more traditional diplomacy. He became known as someone prone to strike first, and ask questions later. Mace Windu considered him one of the Order's finest members. This, along with his skill as a master swordsman, is what made Windu elect him for their final mission."
