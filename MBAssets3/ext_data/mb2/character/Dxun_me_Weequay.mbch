Details:

Often quiet and enigmatic, Weequays can be found throughout the galaxy, from the lower levels of Coruscant to the distant desert flats of Tatooine. They are a humanoid species with coarse, leathery skin and bald heads. By tradition, a Weequay wears a braided topknot on one side of his or her head."
