One of the survivors of the Jedi Purge, this Jedi Padawan found aid and refuge amongst a group of rebel sympathizers on Tatooine, who she promised to help in return.

This quickly drew the attention of stationed Imperial forces who were unwilling to take the chance of leaving this rumor uninvestigated."
