After the raid on Jakku, questions arise regarding FN-2187's competence on the battlefield. He is a scheduled to undergo 'renewal therapy' to ensure his unquestioning loyalty to the First Order, but before that happens, FN-2187 has a profound change of heart, and becomes a fugitive. He adopts the name 'Finn' instead of his numerical designation, the only identity he has ever known. It would seem that Finn's good nature - a gentleness, humour and unerring moral compass - could not be wiped from his mind as it is from others who undergo stormtrooper training."
