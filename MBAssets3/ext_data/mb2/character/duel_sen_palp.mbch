Palpatine was the chancellor of the Republic during the crisis period of the Clone Wars and the consequent fall of the Republic.
Little did anyone suspect how Palpatine had engineered his own rise to power. Hidden beneath a facade of wan smiles and smooth political speeches was a Sith Lord. In truth, Palpatine was well versed in the ways of the Force, having been apprentice to Darth Plagueis the Wise, a Sith Lord who was a master of arcane and unnatural knowledge. In true Sith tradition, Palpatine murdered his Master upon achieving the skill and ability to do so. He then took an apprentice himself, continuing the Sith order in absolute secrecy, right under the noses of the Republic and the Jedi.
