Atton Rand was a pilot native to the planet Alderaan. During the Mandalorian Wars Atton was trained as a Jedi Hunter by Darth Revan, a past which provided him an unorthodox skillset suited to assassination and espionage. He continued to use these skills reluctantly to redeem himself as one of the Lost Jedi who helped Meetra Surik defeat the Sith Triumvirate."
