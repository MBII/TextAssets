Spar, born Alpha-�2 and later known as Mandalore the Resurrector, was a rogue Alpha-class Advanced Recon Commando who rebuilt the Mandalorian Supercommandos and fought for the Confederacy of Independent Systems during the Clone Wars. Alpha-�2 was cloned from the Mandalorian  bounty hunter Jango Fett on the planet Kamino for the Grand Army of the Republic. An aberrant clone with more independence and free-thinking than his fellow soldiers, Alpha-�2 found after eight-and-a-half years that he had inherited the memories of Jango Fett. With the aid of Cuy'val Dar doctor Mij Gilamar, Alpha-�2 made his escape off Kamino in the hold of Slave I, taking the name "Spar" from what the Kaminoan trainers had called him."
