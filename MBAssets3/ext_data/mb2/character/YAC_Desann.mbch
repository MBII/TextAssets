A Chistori Force-sensitive outcast by his native people, Desann was one of Luke's first students at the Jedi Academy on Yavin IV. However, he slowly became more and more cruel and turned to the Dark Side. He has unnaturally strong force abilities due to his drinking in the Force energy of the Valley of the Jedi."
