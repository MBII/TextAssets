A venerable if maverick Jedi Master, Qui-Gon Jinn is a student of the living Force. Unlike other Jedi Masters, who often lose themselves in the meditation of the unifying Force, Qui-Gon Jinn lived for the moment, espousing a philosophy of 'feel, don't think -- use your instincts.' Were it not for Qui-Gon's unruly views, he would have undoubtedly been on the Jedi Council."
