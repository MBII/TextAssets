Engineer droids were B1 battle droids specially programmed to perform as battlefield technicians, pilots, and demolitions experts for the Separatist Droid Army. They were distinguished by their yellow markings.
They were effective at repairing damaged vehicles as well as slicing into enemy vehicles for capture or sabotage.
They were not to be confused with the OOM command battle droid, which also had yellow markings."
