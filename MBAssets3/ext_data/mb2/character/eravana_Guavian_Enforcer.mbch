The Guavian Death Gang's red-armoured foot soldiers are faceless killers who have sworn loyalty in exchange for cybernetic augmentation. A mechanical reservoir pump acts as a second heart, injecting a secret concoction of chemicals directly into the bloodstream, boosting a Guavian soldier's speed and aggression to deadly levels. Everything about them is inhuman and highly illegal."
