Form III (Soresu):
After Darth Maul's defeat on Naboo, Obi-Wan Kenobi decided to enhance his defensive abilities by devoting himself to the study of Form III, the most defensive of all of the forms. Qui-Gon Jinn's fall made it apparent to Obi-Wan that the defenses of Form IV are insufficient, and with the Sith threat reborn, he would need to prepare for possible future encounters.

Inspired by the need to parry blaster-fire, Form III utilizes motions occurring very close to the body to achieve near-total protection, efficiently expending as little energy as possible to execute these moves. This technique keeps the body's exposure to an attacker as minimal as possible, making a well-trained practitioner nearly invincible. Luminara Unduli and Barriss Offee are also proficient in this form."
