Cin Drallig (69 BBY - 19 BBY) was a Jedi Master in the years during and prior to the Clone Wars, and trained Anakin Skywalker in the advanced use of a lightsaber. He was a legendary lightsaber instructor at the Jedi Temple on Coruscant, and though he was not a member of the Jedi Council, his dueling abilities likely rivaled those of the Council members. His apprentice during this time was Serra Keto."
