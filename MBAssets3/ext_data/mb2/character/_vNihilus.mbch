Darth Nihilus was a Human male who reigned as a Dark Lord of the Sith during the era of strife following the Jedi Civil War. He survived the activation of the Mass Shadow Generator superweapon, but was changed irrevocably. The affliction painfully ravaged his body while rendering him a wound in the Force, compelling him to consume Force energy in large quantities to sustain himself. After acceepting Darth Traya's apprenticeship, he became one of the Dark Lords of the Sith Triumvirate."
