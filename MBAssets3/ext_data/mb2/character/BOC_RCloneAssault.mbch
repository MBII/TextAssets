Every Strike Ops. squad had at least a few Clone Elite's. They generally had more advanced training and a repitoire of actual combat experience, so they were well suited to handle the explosive munitions and more advanced weaponry of their units. This Shocktrooper Elite isn't carrying any explosives but has a high-powered rifle."
