During training on Kamino, Fixer became a favorite student of the class's instructor, borderline sociopath Walon Vau. The two both shared a common obsession with weapons, technology and tactics. In fact, Vau and Fixer developed many new close-quarter combat moves.
A clone commando, or Republic commando, was an elite soldier of the Grand Army of the Republic. Often working in groups of four, clone commandos were assigned to carry out covert operations too delicate for regular clone troopers. Covert infiltration, sabotage, foreign unit training, and assassination were standard tasks for the clone commandos."
