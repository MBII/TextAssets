description	"Luke Skywalker

Weaponry:
A Bone

Force Powers:
Force Push (3)
Force Pull (2)

Shortly after his arrival at Jabba's Palace, Luke Skywalker met with the loathsome Hutt and demanded the release of his friends. 

Jabba was much amused, at least until Luke Force Pulled a blaster from the holster of the nearby Nizuc Bek, forcing Jabba to open the Rancor Pit trapdoor beneath Luke's feet and dropping him into the pit with the monster."
