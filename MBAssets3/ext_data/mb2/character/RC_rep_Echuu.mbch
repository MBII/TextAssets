A former Padawan of Mace Windu, Echuu took a Padawan of his own, Stam Reath, before the outbreak of the Clone Wars. The master and his apprentice fought as part of Windu's Jedi task force at the Battle of Geonosis, where they were assigned with the task of destroying several Trade Federation battleship cores. They succeeded, and were then ordered to pursue Count Dooku as he attempted to reach his hangar. Along the way they were intercepted by the Confederacy of Independent Systems General Sev'rance Tann, who quickly slew Echuu's Padawan.

After the battle, Echuu slipped into depression. When Tann reappeared from the shadows, taking Sarapin in a shocking movement with the help of stolen Decimator technology, the Jedi Council hurriedly assigned a new Padawan to Echuuï¿½Naat Reath, Stam's sister."
