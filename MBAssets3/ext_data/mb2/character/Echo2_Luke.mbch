Since the rescue of princess Leia Organa, Luke Skywalker has become a great asset to the Rebellion. Decorated numerous times and is now active on the Hoth base. 
His skills as a pilot are known throughout the Rebellion, but he still tries to train in the way of the Jedi. He has developped a few Powers in the meantime and weilds a Lightsaber.
Though still unskilled in saber combat, he carries a Blaster Pistol to aid him where his saber comes too short."
