Master Drallig was renowned for his formidable lightsaber skills and as Serra's master, Cin Drallig passed on everything he knew of lightsaber technique to the young girl. In time, as Serra became a Jedi Knight herself, she also became known for her skills with a lightsaber as well. As a Jedi, Serra was not shy about expressing her confidence in her abilities. Keto was known for her rebellious nature, and several times, was close to being removed from the Jedi Order."
