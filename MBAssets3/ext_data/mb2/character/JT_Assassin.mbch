The Clone Assassins were trained for only one purpose, the elimination of targets as quickly and as quietly as possible.  They were more than up to the task, and caused chaos in the command chain of the Separatists.

As evidenced in Obi-Wan and Yoda's exploits returning to the Jedi Temple after Order 66, Assassins were able to keep up with even skilled Jedi in close-combat, having enhanced reflexes, reactions, and ability to move with a finesse beyond that of normal beings."
