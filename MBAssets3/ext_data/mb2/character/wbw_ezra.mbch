Ezra Bridger lost his parents when he was seven and grew up as an orphan on Lothal, stealing to make a living and delighting in outfoxing the forces of the Empire. Ezra thought only of himself until the day he encountered a crew of rebels seeking to fight the Empire. During his time with the rebels, Ezra dedicated himself to a purpose beyond simply surviving, and saw his opposition to the Empire as a way to honor his parentsâ€™ sacrifice. He also grew as a Jedi, learning to control his powers and use them responsibly."
